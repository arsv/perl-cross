# perl-cross, being an overlaid changeset, is not particulary
# git- or github-friendly.
#
# To make it look nice on Github, it must carry README, Copying
# and have a plain directory layout. When deploying it onto a perl
# source tree, it's better not to have those files.
#
# Berlios versions were packed to match relevant perl directory
# name, and it worked well at the time.
# However now with the possibility of supporting several perl versions
# and cperl, it makes little sense to keep a single perl version
# in the package name. In most cases, the bundle will be unpacked
# with --strip-compontents=1 anyway.
